            <h1>The List 2024</h1>
            <br />
            <p>
              I play a lot of games every year. Some I have played before, some
              are decades old, and some are new. I wanted to keep track of this,
              so I created <strong>"The List."</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>The List</strong> is the list of every game I have played
              in a year, even if I played for one hour in total. Every Game.
            </p>

            <p>
              So now I will speak of the games that left an impression on me,
              good or bad.

            <h1>Best Game I Barely Play</h1>

            <h2>UNI2</h2>

            <p>
              Last year I tried out Under Night In-Birth Exe: Late[cl-r] also
              known as just Uni. Dumb name aside, I was instantly entranced by
              the visuals and music (primarily the music). The gameplay was
              top-notch even for me, as someone who usually bounces off most
              anime fighting games. I was so interested in the game that I
              started learning about the lore , which is something I only do for
              my favorite fighting games. So when I finally got Uni2 I saw a lot
              of changes. Some I liked some more I didnt. These were mostly
              changes in the visuals like the UI and some remixes I didn't like
              more than the original but at the end of the day the amazing
              gameplay was still pretty much the same. That being said, Uni is
              still a game I very much enjoy but not enough to take my attention
              away from the next game on the list.

          <div id="listAward">
            <h1>Can't Stop Playing</h1>

            <h2>Tekken 8</h2>

            <p>
              Like with Uni2 I played the predecessor to this game, Tekken 7 and
              I greatly enjoyed my time playing. Tekken 8 takes everything I
              liked about Tekken 7 and turns it up to eleven. The game is faster
              paced, the music is even music, the graphics are beautiful, and
              the heat system allows some characters new flashy and powerful
              moves that always feel good to use. The game is filled with depth
              so it feels like you're constantly learning new stuff and when
              you're actually able to pull it off in a match the satisfaction is
              unmatched. Currently this is my favorite fighting game and second
              place is far behind.

            <h1>Surprising Good</h1>

            <h2>FF7 Intermission</h2>

            <p>
              The remake will get its own page because I have many thoughts
              about that game mostly, negative. So after finishing the game I
              was expecting the same from the DLC Intergrade or Intermission
              (idk why it has two different names). However, after finishing it
              I was engrossed from start to finish. Since this is a shorter
              contained story it doesn't have to be stretched to be 30 hours
              long like the remake so it makes for a very short and enjoyable
              experience with more fun gameplay, an amazing soundtrack, and a
              cheesy but enjoyable story all wrapped up in a nice 5 hour game.

            <h1>Most Disappointing</h1>

            <h2>Rivals 2</h2>

            <p>
              Don't let the disappointing part fool you, this game is not bad
              it's actually pretty good. With that being said I don't like this
              game very much which is extra sad because it is the sequel to my
              favorite fighting game of all time. Pretty much every aspect is
              not as good as the original. I prefer the pixel art style,
              chiptune soundtrack, and more unique gameplay compared to most
              platform fighters. Maybe in a couple years I will end up liking it
              but currently I'm not interested at all.

            <h1>Honorable Mentions</h1>

            <h2>FF7</h2>
            <p>
              My 2nd favorite game I played this year. Truly a charming
              experience from start to finish and even playing this 20 years
              later it still amazed me with what they were able to accomplish.
              It easily earns its spot as one of the greatest games ever made.
            </p>

            <h2>Star of Providence</h2>
            <p>
              Roguelikes are my favorite genre and Star of Providence is a very
              good one. The game is just really fun and hard. Highly Recommend
            </p>

            <h2>P3R</h2>
            <p>
              I've played Persona 3, 4, and 5 and 3 is easily my favorite.The
              character and story writing while being more "dark" is much more
              satisfying to watch play out while also being relatable to some of
              the struggles seen. While most persona characters clearly have
              flaws, persona 3's characters feel more real than the other games
              by a mile. As always the visuals, art style and music are top
              notch.
            </p>

            <h2>Brave</h2>
            <p>
              This one is weird. Every now and then I like playing random games
              I find on steam. I went into this one expecting the usual bad game
              experience I can laugh at and move on but Brave was surprisingly
              fun. It's the usual action, adventure platformer game you will see
              with most kids games like this but the combat kept me hooked for
              some reason. I wanted to just keep playing to see all the bosses
              and what all the upgrades do. If I enjoyed the Final Fantasy 7
              Remake this would be in the surprisingly good spot.
            </p>

          <div id="listAward">
            <h1>Worst Game</h1>

            <h2>Tangled</h2>
            <p>
              There's not much to say about this one. It's just boring. It is a
              kids game after all.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="listAward">
            <h1>Best Game</h1>
            <h2>Until Then</h2>
            <p>
              My Game of the Year. Until then was a game I first saw on steam
              and went "that game looks pretty" and almost moved on until I saw
              there was a demo available. Let me preface this by saying that I
              do not play games for story, I play them for gameplay first and
              foremost if the story is good that's a plus. All that being said
              Until Then, a visual novel was a game that sucked me in instantly.
              The writing is excellent, every one of the main characters are
              extremely likable with fun interactions and dialogue from start to
              finish. The story hits extremely hard and then keeps going only to
              keep going harder to hammer in its message in one of the most
              interesting, enjoyable, and emotional journeys I have ever
              experienced. I don't want to say more because you should just play
              this game. It is truly amazing.
